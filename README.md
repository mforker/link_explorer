# link_explorer - A learning project

Hello,

My name is Mitesh Nandan and i am currently learning web scraping using puppeteer in js. This is my test project at the very initial phase of the project. I don't have a technical academic background but i have been learing to code by myself. I have completed a Data Analytics specialization certification by google from coursera where i learned to use tools like R, SQL, Tableau, Excel to clean, transform, analyse, visualise data and create reports. My motivation to learn scraping is to expand my data collection capabilities and perform better analysis.

The `scraper.js` file in the `link_scraper` folder is a script that does the following:

- visits `https://www.w3schools.com/`
- scrapes all the links form that page
- stores it in array

I understand that it very basic but I have just started to learn and have a log way to go.
